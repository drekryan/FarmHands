**Requires:** WorldGuard 6.1.3-SNAPSHOT

FarmHands is a Minecraft Spigot Plugin that adds a custom WorldGuard flag
to auto replace crops when they are harvested.

This allows players to harvest crops without having to remember to
replant it. That way your farms are always fully planted and ready
to grow.
